# Algorithms & Data Structures
Implementation of different known algorithms and data structures in C++

## Disclaimer
By the time, this repository will grow, recieving more entries. Keep in mind that all examples given here are just standart implementations of those algorithms, which, probably, need some tweaks to be used in your specific task

## Resources
Of course, I haven't figured this ideas and implementations myself; Here are resources I've learned this information from:
* Steven Halim & Felix Halim - Competitive Programming 3: The New Lower Bound of Programming Contests ([link](https://cpbook.net/))
* ITMO Academy: pilot course from Codeforces ([link](https://codeforces.com/edu/courses))
* WilliamFiset's Youtube channel and GitHub repository ([github](https://github.com/williamfiset/algorithms), [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD8yeTczadqdARzQUp29PJw))
